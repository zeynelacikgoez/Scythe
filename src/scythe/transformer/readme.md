# Hyperbolic Transformer Project

The **Hyperbolic Transformer** project is a modular implementation of a transformer-based model that leverages hyperbolic geometry to better capture hierarchical relationships in data. This project is organized into several components including configuration, datasets, model definition, training, inference, and various utility functions.

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the package and re-exports key components.

- **`config.py`**  
  Contains global configuration parameters (hyperparameters, data paths, etc.).

- **`dataset.py`**  
  Implements data loading and preprocessing (using, for example, a custom PyTorch Dataset class).

- **`model.py`**  
  Defines the main model architecture (e.g., `HyperbolicTransformer`), which integrates modules from the `modules/` folder.

- **`modules/`**  
  Contains individual building blocks:
  - **`prenet.py`**: Input mapping to a hidden representation and projection into hyperbolic space.
  - **`postnet.py`**: Maps hidden representations back to the output space.
  - **`hyperbolic_cube.py`**: Implements a multi-layer (pyramidal/cube) structure for deep hyperbolic transformations.
  - **`hyperbolic_attention.py`**: An experimental self-attention mechanism adapted for hyperbolic geometry.
  - **`positional_encoding.py`**: Provides positional encoding for sequence data, optionally adapted for hyperbolic space.
  - **`specialized_layer.py`**: Contains additional specialized layers, for example a hyperbolic feed-forward network.

- **`train.py`**  
  Contains the training loop: loading datasets, initializing the model, setting up the optimizer (e.g., RiemannianAdam), and saving checkpoints.

- **`inference.py`**  
  Provides functions to load a trained model and run inference on new input data.

- **`utils.py`**  
  Includes utility functions for logging, metrics, and additional hyperbolic operations.

- **`readme.md`**  
  This file. It provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Modules Overview

### 1. PreNet (`modules/prenet.py`)
- **Purpose:**  
  Maps raw input features (e.g., embeddings) to a hidden representation and projects them into hyperbolic space using an exponential map.
- **Usage Example:**  
  ```python
  x = self.prenet(x)  # x: [batch_size, seq_len, input_dim] → [batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim]
  ```

### 2. PostNet (`modules/postnet.py`)
- **Purpose:**  
  Transforms hidden representations back to the output space by applying a logarithmic map followed by a linear projection.
- **Usage Example:**  
  ```python
  output = self.postnet(x)  # x: [batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim] → [batch_size, seq_len, output_dim]
  ```

### 3. HyperbolicCube (`modules/hyperbolic_cube.py`)
- **Purpose:**  
  Implements a stacked layer structure (cube or pyramid) that applies a series of linear transformations and maps the results into hyperbolic space.
- **Usage Example:**  
  ```python
  x = self.hyperbolic_cube(x)
  ```

### 4. HyperbolicAttention (`modules/hyperbolic_attention.py`)
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides an experimental self-attention mechanism adapted to the hyperbolic setting. Note that this module currently uses a simplified approach that relies on Euclidean dot-product operations after mapping data back to the Euclidean space.
- **Usage Example:**  
  ```python
  x = self.hyperbolic_attention(x)
  ```

### 5. Positional Encoding (`modules/positional_encoding.py`)
- **Purpose:**  
  Adds positional information to the input sequences using sinusoidal functions, optionally projecting the results into hyperbolic space.
- **Usage Example:**  
  ```python
  x = self.pos_encoding(x)
  ```

### 6. Specialized Layer (`modules/specialized_layer.py`)
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides additional layer types, such as a hyperbolic feed-forward layer that alternates between Euclidean and hyperbolic operations.
- **Usage Example:**  
  ```python
  x = self.hyperbolic_ffn(x)
  ```

## Usage

### Training

Run the training script from the command line:

```bash
python -m hyperbolic_transformer.train
```

Model checkpoints will be saved in the directory specified in `config.py`.

### Inference

You can load a trained model and run inference on new data as follows:

```python
import torch
from hyperbolic_transformer.inference import run_inference

# Create example input data: [batch_size, seq_len, input_dim]
input_data = torch.randn(2, 10, 300)
outputs = run_inference(input_data, "checkpoints/model_epoch10.pt")
print(outputs)
```
